                Clothing in itself does not count as armor, but it does grant Armor Reduction.
                While wearing clothing and robes, a character counts as ”unarmored”, meaning that they can add
                their level to rolls for defensive actions.
            </div>
            <div *ngIf="armor.armorType === _armorType.LIGHT">
                Light armor is flexible and allows agile users to move around freely. It can usually be donned and
                doffed in a matter of one or two minutes. Leather, fur and very light, but also very expensive
                metals or metal chains are used to create light armor. While wearing light armor, a character’s
                Agility can not exceed 10.
            </div>
            <div *ngIf="armor.armorType === _armorType.MEDIUM">
                Medium Armor is a great balance between the strong defenses of heavy armor and the agility of
                light armor. It is often made of cloth with strips of metal sewn in, or with leather pads. It can also
                consist of overlapping slabs of metal or leather, giving the armor scales. It takes 5 Minutes to don
                or remove medium armor. While wearing medium armor, a character’s Agility can not exceed 8.
            </div>
            <div *ngIf="armor.armorType === _armorType.HEAVY">
                Heavy Armor is slow and clunky, but also adds the biggest bonus to armor of any type. It requires
                at least 10 minutes to don and doff such a piece of armor, and while wearing Heavy Armor, the
                wearer’s Agility can not exceed a value of 6.
